        <h1>Queens Gambit</h1>
        <p>White offers a pawn on the c4 square to challenge Black’s central d5 pawn and gain control of the center. 
            This "gambit" is considered a misnomer, as Black cannot safely hold onto the pawn without incurring a disadvantage.
             The Queen’s Gambit is divided into two major categories based on Black's response. If Black captures the c4 pawn with dxc4, 
              White will build a strong center. If they don’t white can advance other minor pieces like the knight and the bishop.

        <h1>Ruy Lopez </h1>
        <p>The Ruy López, also known as the Spanish Opening, is a classic chess opening beginning with
             1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5, where White pins Black’s knigh
             t on c6 to pressure the pawn on e5 and pursue central contro.
              Named after 16th‑century Spanish priest Ruy López de Segura, 
              who formalized it in his 1561 treatise, this opening is famed 
              for its strategic depth, positional richness, and rich theory . 
              Although theory‑heavy, it remains popular at all levels—from 
              beginners learning fundamental principles like development and
               king safety to grandmasters playing deeply analyzed lines
                including Closed, Berlin, Exchange, and Marshall variations</p>

        <h1>Kings Gambit</h1>
        <p>White sacrifices a pawn early to disrupt Black’s central control and rapidly develop pieces, aiming for a swift kingside attack. 
            This opening leads to sharp, tactical positions and was favored by Romantic-era players like Paul Morphy and Adolf Anderssen. 
            While less common at the highest levels today due to modern defensive techniques, it remains popular in faster time controls and among players who enjoy dynamic, attacking play. The King's Gambit offers exciting, double-edged positions that can catch opponents off guard, making it a thrilling choice for aggressive players.</p>
