            <h1>Queens Gambit</h1>
            <p>White offers a pawn on the c4 square to challenge Black’s central d5 pawn and gain control of the center. 
                This "gambit" is considered a misnomer, as Black cannot safely hold onto the pawn without incurring a disadvantage.
                The Queen’s Gambit is divided into two major categories based on Black's response. If Black captures the c4 pawn with dxc4, 
                White will build a strong center. If they don’t white can advance other minor pieces like the knight and the bishop.

            <h1>Ruy Lopez </h1>
            <p>The Ruy López, also known as the Spanish Opening, is a classic chess opening beginning with
                1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5, where White pins Black’s knight on c6 to pressure the pawn on e5 and pursue central contro.
                Named after 16th‑century Spanish priest Ruy López de Segura, 
                who formalized it in his 1561 treatise, this opening is famed 
                for its strategic depth, positional richness, and rich theory . 
                Although theory‑heavy, it remains popular at all levels—from 
                beginners learning fundamental principles like development and
                king safety to grandmasters playing deeply analyzed lines
                including Closed, Berlin, Exchange, and Marshall variations</p>

            <h1>Kings Gambit</h1>
            <p>White sacrifices a pawn early to disrupt Black’s central control and rapidly develop pieces, aiming for a swift kingside attack. 
                This opening leads to sharp, tactical positions and was favored by Romantic-era players like Paul Morphy and Adolf Anderssen. 
                While less common at the highest levels today due to modern defensive techniques, it remains popular in faster time controls and among players who enjoy dynamic, attacking play. The King's Gambit offers exciting, double-edged positions that can catch opponents off guard, making it a thrilling choice for aggressive players.</p>

            <h1>Sicilian Defense</h1>
            <p>The Sicilian Defense is a chess opening where Black responds to White's first move 
                1.e4 with the move 1...c5. This immediately breaks the symmetry of the board and allows
                 Black to fight for control of the central d4-square with a flank pawn. It is Black's most
                  popular response to 1.e4 and leads to dynamic, sharp, and often complicated positions, with 
                  many different variations such as the Najdorf and Open Sicilian. </p>
