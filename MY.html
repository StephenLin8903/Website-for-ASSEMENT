        <p>The Ruy López, also known as the Spanish Opening, is a classic chess opening beginning with
             1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5, where White pins Black’s knigh
             t on c6 to pressure the pawn on e5 and pursue central contro.
              Named after 16th‑century Spanish priest Ruy López de Segura, 
              who formalized it in his 1561 treatise, this opening is famed 
              for its strategic depth, positional richness, and rich theory . 
              Although theory‑heavy, it remains popular at all levels—from 
              beginners learning fundamental principles like development and
               king safety to grandmasters playing deeply analyzed lines
                including Closed, Berlin, Exchange, and Marshall variations</p>
